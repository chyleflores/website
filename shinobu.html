                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Shinobu is a petite young woman with a slender and short build and a fairly pale complexion. She has large eyes that lack pupils, only a haze of gradient purple, making her eyes appear similar to those of insects. She has very short raven-black wavy hair that fades into dark purple at the ends, styled at the back of her head into a flat yakai-maki bun, fastened with a white, turquoise and light purple butterfly ornament. She has center-split, ear-length, voluminous curtain bangs that flow down to frame the sides of her face, with two slightly thinner chin-length locks of hair in front of her ears below them. She stands out among the more physically imposing Hashira due to her diminutive stature and small frame, which is later reinforced by her mentioning that she does not possess enough physical strength to decapitate a demon as the others do. According to Zenitsu, Shinobu is so cute that she could make a living on her looks alone.</p>
                <p>Shinobu wears a dark purple tinted standard Demon Slayer uniform, consisting of a button-up jacket with golden buttons, stand collar, and long sleeves, having the kanji for "Destroy" engraved on the back, a shirt pocket on top of the left breast, matching the dark purple color of her tabi socks and her long saggy tattsuke hakama pants, that is wrapped by a pair of white butterfly-patterned Kyahan fading into a pale turquoise to pink shade around her lower legs, fastened with white ribbons. Over her uniform, she wears a white haori that previously belonged to her older sister, which has a butterfly wing pattern, specially that of a Monarch Butterfly, that fades into a pale turquoise then pink color gradient on the sleeves and hem which are cuffed with a black and white dotted trim. She wears white zōri sandals with purple straps for footwear; she conceals a hidden blade in the right sandal.</p>

                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Shinobu always has a pleasant expression on her face and is first thought to be laid back and friendly, wanting to establish some peace between humans and Demons. It is later revealed that she hates Demons with a burning passion after a Demons killed her parents and her older sister. She enjoys teasing people and can be a bit sadistic, she knows how to make people tick and how to make them move the way she wants them to. When she was younger she was shown to be more straightforward and quick to anger but after Kanae’s death, Shinobu started to behave like her sister. She also has an inferiority complex since she isn’t as tall as strong as the other Pillars.</p>

                        <li>Master Swordsman: Being a Pillar of the Demon Slayer Corps, Shinobu is one of the most powerful and skilled swordsmen in the entire organization.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Medical Expertise: Despite not being as combat oriented as the rest of the Pillars, Shinobu instead displays immense skill and mastery over medical and pharmaceutical fields to make up for her lack of natural born combat talent. She is highly knowledgeable about how to create various poisons and venoms using wisteria flowers, as well as the medical skills needed to counteract the venoms and poisons created by demons.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Immense Speed: Shinobu has displayed almost superhuman levels of speed. Doma stated she might have been the fastest Pillar he has ever met.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Enhanced Strength: Although possessing the weakest swing strength due to her small arms, Shinobu instead has a powerful thrust and stab strength. A single thrust from her sword could easily pierce a stone boulder in half.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unique weapon: Shinobu used a heavily modified katana, the handle to slightly above the hilt is the same but above that, the blade is replaced with a thin rod and ends in a needle like tip, similar to an insect's stinger in appearance and function.

                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Poisonous Body: In order to defeat Upper Moon Two, Doma who killed her sister, Shinobu heavily transformed her body by absorbing and altering her body's physiology with highly concentrated wisteria based poison. With the assistance of the Demon doctor, Tamayo, Shinobu is successful in saturating her body with undetectable poison that has completely merged with her body's own cell structures, including those of her blood and internal organs, all the way down to the very tips of her fingernails. Her body is the equivalent of 37 kilograms worth of poison, approximately 70 times more than the lethal amount needed to kill an average demon. The poison being strong enough to melt Doma, down to his bones.</li>
